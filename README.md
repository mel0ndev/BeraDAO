# BeraDAO
A decentralized platform for shorting any coin available on a dex. 


BeraDAO is a decentralized organization working towards easily integrating hedging and shorting options for defi traders. The current system
prohibits several countries, namely the United States, from leverage trading, so we have to add new and innovative ways to replace the CEXs with
a decentralized equivalent. The primary focus of this DAO is creating decentralized long-lasting dapps and tools for defi traders to use without having 
to worry about getting their funds locked or KYCing. 


### Want to help? 
You can create a fork of this project, submit a PR, or get in contract on twitter @bera_dao with any ideas or changes you'd like to implement. 
Try checking out  ```todo.md``` for things that I am currently working on or things that need to be completed. Refactors are welcomed, as long as you
include lots of comments to help my smooth brain understand what you've done. 

I was planning on releasing the original dapp for this project completely solo, but I thought it would be much more fun to include others in the development
process, because I know that my own knowledge is limited. To create the best possible tools, I'd like to leverage the power that DAOs offer. That being said...


### Compensation
There will be tokens airdropped to users who assist in the creation of the dapp. Anyone involved with the DAO prior to the release of the inital project, BeraMarket, 
will receive additional tokens. 

If you don't know how to code, the DAO needs lots of art! Any kind of memes, background art, or drawings are welcomed. Anything that I use on the main site will obviously 
be fairly compensated for.
