# The BeraDAO Ecosystem 
## A plan to create a sustainable business and ecosystem via negative delta products 
### A proposal by 0xMelon

#### The Dream
I want to create an ecosystem in which it is easy for an end user to come to the platform and execute a short trade. They don't have to worry about stop losses, charts, or calculating position sizing. I want it to be as easy as possible for someone to click a button and be short. The time to go from identifying a shitcoin that has just launched and being able to short it in on BeraMarket will be only as long as it takes for the user to access the site. Wit this in mind, I would like to create incentives to drive users to the platform. This is a novel product, and will need some time to get off the ground. That being said, there are a few ways that I can think of that might help me the adoption I want: 

#####  A liquidity mining program
Users deposit dai into the pools as they would to receive a fee of the losses to the pool, but also receive $HONEY, which then receives a portion of all trading fees on the platform. By staking their honey, they are able to earn an additional yield. This lets farmer come in to provide liquidity, but also allows users to accumulate the token for a larger proportion of fees on the platform. 


##### The next step
Once users are familiar with the platform, the BeraGovernence platform will be launched. The $HONEY that has been earned can be staked for $BERA which will allow users to participate in the governance of the protocol.
